 <title>Taxco and Semana Santa</title>
 <link>http://www.neilmeyerhoff.com/content/taxco-and-semana-santa</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;We have come to Mexico to photograph the religious processions in several towns that celebrate the events surrounding Christ&#039;s death and resurrection. Our first stop is the famous silver mining town of Taxco.  There are many churches in Taxco and each church takes part in the nighty processions.  The churches take their statues down from the alters and walk them around the town on litters carried on the shoulders of male congregants. They are sometimes accompanied by bands playing music.  One group was also dressed as Middle Eastern shepherds.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Blown-up in San Miguel de Allende</title>
 <link>http://www.neilmeyerhoff.com/content/blown-san-miguel-de-allende</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In Queretaro, in the state of the same name, we photographed the late afternoon silent procession that winds through the city streets.  The men carry crosses on their shoulders and wear hooded robes very much like to those worn by the KKK.  The same hooded robes are worn in Seville, Spain for a similar procession, and it is thought that the Klan got the idea for the robes from either Seville or Queretaro.  It would be ironic if this were true, as the Klan was anti-Catholic, and these processions are in heavily Catholic nations.  The robes are red, white, black, or grey.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Not arrested, now photographing in San Miguel de Allende</title>
 <link>http://www.neilmeyerhoff.com/content/not-arrested-now-photographing-san-miguel-de-allende</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;When I last wrote we were outside the police station waiting to find out if the driver or vehicle were going to be in trouble. Just a few minutes later we were on our way. We don&#039;t know how the issue of transporting tourists without a tourist license plate was resolved. We arrived in San Miguel about on time as the drivers way exceed the speed limits to make up time.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Stopped by the police!</title>
 <link>http://www.neilmeyerhoff.com/content/stopped-police</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;We are travelling in two Chevy SUVs with the back portion full of luggage, so there is no vision out the back. The other car just got stopped by the police as its license plate is not one that authorizes the driver to carry tourists. We initially kept going, but have just turned around to go with the other SUV to the local police station to pay a fine, or maybe a bribe, to let us proceed. We are now in a small town at the police station.  We have exited the SUVs and are sitting in the shade awaiting the outcome of the police situation.&lt;/p&gt;
