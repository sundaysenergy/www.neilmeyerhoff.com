        <div class="content"><p>March 8, 2010:<br />
Today started very early.  I woke up about 3:45AM and was ready to go out at 4:30.  The only problem was we weren’t leaving the hotel to photograph until 5:30, and in actuality we didn’t leave the hotel until 5:55.  We drove for quite a while to get to the other side of the river to photograph the backside of the Taj Mahal.  The light didn’t get good until around 7:10, and I got only one really good shot, #4448.  In the past you could walk down onto the riverbed and if there was enough water you could see the Taj Mahal reflected in the water.  However, the river has been very dry for several years and only in monsoon season is there enough water to such a shot.  But now that shot is prohibited for security reasons and a razor-wire fence blocks access to the riverbed. Also at that location there is a security outpost for the soldiers who man the watchtowers.  Right next to this spot is a pretty garden that can be used as a foreground for images of the Taj.  That is where that stitched panoramic shot of the Taj was taken.</p>
<p>We left that site around 8, and got through the Taj Mahal security by 8:45.  We were supposed to leave at 9:45 to go back to the hotel to have breakfast.  We all got the same shots of the Taj, more or less, and left at about 10:15. Five of us went to the Oberoi hotel right near the Taj to have breakfast.  The buffet was about $20 and we all ate more than we needed in order to get our money’s worth.  We then took some photos of the beautiful pool area.  On the last visit Sayra and I did the same routine and the stock agency has sold some of the Hasseblad X-pan panoramic shots I took on that visit to this hotel.  I got 4 nice stitched shots and other single shots, so it was a good use of the $40 breakfast for two.</p>
<p>We went out again at 3:30 to a spot near the Agra Fort that we had seen from the Taj Mahal that the guides said would provide a nice afternoon shot of the tomb.  Well, the location was a garbage dump with a stream of sewage running through it.  It smelled bad and the view was not good.  Steve McCurry was very angry that the guides had given us bad information.  We got back into the cars and drove about 15 minutes to the other side of the river near the railway bridge, and then began to walk in the dry, sandy riverbed to try to reach a photographic spot.  I did photograph a lot of sarees being dried on the sand, but they were only just okay.  We kept walking through the sand and scrub, but the view was not great.  Finally we reached a point where the guides said we could go no further as we were already in the restricted area across from the Taj and could be shot by the guards. Several suspicious characters have been caught in this area in the past.  The guides said if we continued further, (and if the guards were paying attention) they might shoot first and ask questions later.  There are no signs saying the area is restricted, but the guides said the soldiers would see them as local guides who had brought tourists into what they, the guides knew, was a prohibited area.</p>
<p>As we were standing there the Taj appeared much clearer than this morning. I commented that the view was better than this morning and that we should go back to where we photographed this morning.  Steve agreed and we then tried to figure out how to get to that spot without a long walk back to the railroad bridge.  Steve felt the locals must have made a hole in the fence and a minute later I saw a local person walk under the fence.  So, we decided to do the same thing.  Catherine and I went ahead and we made sure we each kept close enough to the ground to not get caught in the razor wire.  From that point we could see where the road was, and I told Steve I was going to walk through the field to the road to wait for the vehicles.  Well, no one else seemed to follow, so I found myself waiting by the road alone.  Just like at Angkor Wat in January, I was off by myself. I was glad to be by myself as I got a great portrait of a young girl, #4471.  </p>
<p>When I got to the fence line where we were this morning, I took a few shots that will be okay, and then walked along the fence to the garden area. I got lucky and got a shot of a woman with a carrying a bundle on her head as she passed on the other side of the fence, and had an out of focus image of the Taj in the background.  Then some kids showed up along the fence line and several of us took a bunch of shots of the children, a few of us making use of the barbed wire as framing devices. I photographed one girl in particular, working with her for a few minutes. Although I don't normally pay people for photographs, I gave the girl a dollars worth of rupees.  The lighting was very magical at this time, #4466.   </p>
<p>As we were taking these pictures we kept asking each other where Steve McCurry was.  He was last seen tramping through the fields towards the security outpost on the fence line.  He eventually emerged from the fields right at the security outpost and the guards gave him a very strange look, as he was not where he should have been.</p>
